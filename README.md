# Chino Pie

**Yet another deep learning framework to train and validate models with Pytorch, for lightweight academic research purposes.**

Chino Pie (py) is a python implementation of Chino.

Still working in progress. The API is unstable and will change rapidly.

**You may want to check the dev branch for the latest updates.**

## The Goal

- Be easy to the starter. Be clear to the experienced.
- Easy to decouple.
- Handle dirty works in deep learning.

## Concepts

- **Decouple** your designs and scripts with `Moudle` and `Recipe`.
- **Unified** file management with `Helper`, covering your checkpoints, data, states, logs and more.
- **Code** as note. Scene `Snapshot` catches your academic progress automatically.
- `Bootstrap` your model with **auto optimization** and **many strategies** if you know them.
- Bulit-in lightweight distributed data `parallelization`.
- ~~Useful `probe` and `dataset` for common researches.~~
