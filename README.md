# Chino Pie

**Yet another deep learning framework to train and validate models with Pytorch.**

Chino Pie (py) is a python implementation of Chino.

Still working in progress. The API is unstable and will change rapidly.

## The Goal

- Be easy to the starter. Be clear to the experienced.
- Easy to decouple.
- Handle dirty works in deep learning.
